<tr><h4 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 23px;">This app is being used to enable participation in an academic research study conducted by Professor Blase Ur and his students and collaborators at the University of Chicago. The research protocol is pending review at the University of Chicago's Institutional Review Board (IRB) as Research Protocol #IRB22-0310.

          The goal of this work is to better understand users' perceptions of explanations of file recommendations. To do so, our application requests access to the files stored in your Google Drive account. This survey uses OAuth2 to give our tool limited access to your Google Drive account that you can revoke at any time. Our tool does not have access to your password in any way.<br></h4></tr>

          <tr><h3 style="color: #447BB7">Information we collect<h3><h4 style="text-align: justify; line-height: 23px;">In order to enable some functionality in our file management interface, we request permission to read files in your Google Drive account, and perform an automated scan. We do not store file content: however, file names, folder names, objects recognized in images, and some words from documents are saved in order to study the links between types of files and management strategies. We will never have access to your password, and we do not store your username in the course of our study. You can read more about how Google allows third parties to access your account, and how you can manage this access here: <a href=https://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=143031>Google OAuth Access</a>. For images stored in your account, we use software provided by the Google Vision API. It is the policy of the Google Vision API not to access or use data provided to them except for the purposes of performing offered services (<a href=https://cloud.google.com/terms/>Google Cloud Terms</a>). We save information about the types of objects the software recognized (e.g., whether there appears to be a kite in the photo), but we do not save the files themselves. </h4></tr>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li> <b>Profile</b> We request access to your profile in order to ensure participants
              do not register for the study more than once with the same Google Drive account.
              We store an encrypted version of your ID. Researchers will not have access to any plain
              text identifiable information about you.</li>
            <li><b>Read-only file and folder access</b> We request read-only access to perform analysis
              on files so that we can provide recommendations of file management actions when you use
              our interface. We store file metadata such as file names and last modified timestamps
              as well as some extracted content (key words in files, objects recognized in images,
              column names from data tables) indefinitely for research and analysis purposes on
              an encrypted server at the University of Chicago belonging to
              <a href=https://super.cs.uchicago.edu>SUPERgroup</a>. This data will only be
              accessible to study personnel, and will not be shared with others or used
              for any purpose aside from research.</li>
